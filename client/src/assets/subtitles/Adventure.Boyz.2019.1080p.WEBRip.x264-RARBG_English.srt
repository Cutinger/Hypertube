1
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,606
This magnificent castle is
now officially a crime scene.

2
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,443
50 extremely rare and highly
valuable diamonds that have

3
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,580
been in the Hurst family for
generations have been stolen

4
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,217
from this high security
tower right here behind me.

5
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,453
Police are appealing for any information that could lead towards

6
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,223
the arrest of these criminals
or criminal involved

7
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,357
in this despicable crime.

8
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,194
Lady Hurst was unavailable
for comment,

9
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,897
but those close to her
say that she is devastated

10
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,600
by the loss of these gems
that were handed down

11
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,835
to her as a child
by her late mother.

12
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,228
- Are your arms broken?
- No.

13
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,396
Are your legs broken?

14
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,864
No.

15
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,467
Are you alive?

16
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:49,868
Yes.

17
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,603
Then let's go.

18
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,938
<i>Somehow Daddy was always</i>

19
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,607
<i>there to pick us up</i>
<i>and dust us off.</i>

20
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,509
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

21
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,212
<i>Let me give you some context.</i>

22
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,248
<i>It was that summer when the</i>
<i>green turned to golden brown.</i>

23
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,287
<i>We actually live in Glen Close.</i>

24
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,924
<i>It's the same name as some</i>
<i>American movie actress,</i>

25
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,592
<i>apparently quite talented.</i>

26
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,296
<i>We've won the lottery of life,</i>
<i>Dad says.</i>

27
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,667
<i>He says there are people</i>
<i>starving, no water in the tap,</i>

28
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,470
<i>let alone England's greenest</i>
<i>hills and beautiful views.</i>

29
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,573
<i>There's a saying, "You've don't</i>

30
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,308
<i>know what you've got</i>
<i>till it's gone."</i>

31
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,311
<i>Well, I was soon going to</i>
<i>understand what that meant.</i>

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,814
<i>You don't know me yet,</i>
<i>but my name is Sam.</i>

33
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,551
<i>This is my brother, Jake.</i>

34
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>Cute, they all say.</i>

35
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,621
<i>These guys are</i>
<i>the reasons our parents</i>

36
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,824
<i>invented neighborhood</i>
<i>watch, dodgy.</i>

37
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,927
<i>This guy, I've got a four</i>
<i>letter word for him.</i>

38
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,597
<i>Actually, it's five letters.</i>

39
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,465
<i>I was never that</i>
<i>good at spelling.</i>

40
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,934
<i>We'll come back to them.</i>
<i>You yell if you see them around.</i>

41
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,303
<i>This is my mom,</i>

42
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,938
<i>that's my school.</i>

43
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,242
<i>My mom is the sensible one.</i>

44
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,843
<i>That's a good quality</i>
<i>for a mommy.</i>

45
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,479
<i>Daddy, however,</i>
<i>is a bit different.</i>

46
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,615
<i>He's a speedway racer.</i>

47
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,951
<i>Mommy thinks he should stop,</i>
<i>but he loves it too much.</i>

48
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,356
<i>You know, these speedway</i>
<i>bikes don't even have brakes.</i>

49
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,993
<i>The only breaks are</i>
<i>your bones, Mom says.</i>

50
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,470
<i>He used to be a champ,</i>

51
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,639
<i>but that was long before</i>
<i>we came along.</i>

52
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,641
<i>It's been so long</i>
<i>since he's won,</i>

53
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,609
<i>his trophies are gathering dust.</i>

54
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,879
<i>Something happened</i>
<i>with Mommy and Daddy.</i>

55
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,415
<i>I don't know what exactly,</i>
<i>but grownups are funny.</i>

56
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,918
<i>Everything is a military</i>
<i>operation to him.</i>

57
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,721
<i>He even cuts the hedge</i>
<i>like he's on a mission.</i>

58
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,456
<i>He has a machine in the garage,</i>

59
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,026
<i>but he insists on using</i>
<i>these big green scissors.</i>

60
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,764
<i>He treats everything as exercise</i>
<i>and a test of precision.</i>

61
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,336
<i>He's got this crazy</i>
<i>American car.</i>

62
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,405
<i>He loves that car.</i>

63
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,974
<i>Mom says he loves it</i>
<i>more than her.</i>

64
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,743
<i>Dad seems obsessed with America.</i>

65
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,612
<i>He met Mom there and they drove</i>

66
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,614
<i>around America</i>
<i>in this big old car.</i>

67
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,084
<i>Apparently, I was made</i>
<i>in the back seat or something,</i>

68
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,320
<i>but I really don't want</i>
<i>to talk about that.</i>

69
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,022
<i>Apparently it's the exact</i>
<i>car that was used</i>

70
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,993
<i>in some American movie, staring</i>
<i>Clive Eastman or something,</i>

71
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,995
<i>but I can't quite</i>
<i>remember its name.</i>

72
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,099
It's Clint, Clint Eastwood,

73
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,935
and he's the finest movie
star who ever lived.

74
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,006
And because of his movies,
he'll always live.

75
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,544
<i>It's so precious,</i>
<i>he won't even drive it.</i>

76
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,547
<i>He's a bit of a joker.</i>

77
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,617
<i>He used to set traps with</i>
<i>string and stuff like that.</i>

78
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,058
- Seriously?
- Hmm.

79
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,895
<i>One Halloween,</i>
<i>he pulled this gag.</i>

80
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,864
Why don't
we go to the park?

81
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,106
Oh, Jake, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,909
It's just a silly mask, okay?

83
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,046
Just a silly mask.

84
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,114
I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,915
<i>Jake cried for hours.</i>

86
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,985
<i>That morning before</i>
<i>it all happened,</i>

87
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,954
<i>a bird circled the house.</i>

88
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,656
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>it was a sign.</i>

89
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>Apparently these signs</i>
<i>are everywhere,</i>

90
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,963
<i>if only we knew where to look.</i>

91
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,799
<i>So, Mom's off back to America.</i>

92
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,567
<i>Oh, bye, boys.</i>

93
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,140
- You be good for Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

94
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,075
<i>This is the moment Daddy</i>
<i>should have stopped</i>

95
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,511
<i>Mommy leaving, but he didn't.</i>

96
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,146
I love you guys.

97
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,515
Come on.
- <i>They think we don't notice</i>

98
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,784
<i>the looks they give</i>
<i>each other behind our backs,</i>

99
00:06:58,786 --> 00:06:59,885
<i>but we do.</i>

100
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,890
<i>I've become something</i>
<i>of a lip reading expert.</i>

101
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,659
<i>A skill I had no ambition</i>
<i>to acquire,</i>

102
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,961
<i>but it was going to</i>
<i>prove more of a lifesaver</i>

103
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,897
<i>than I ever could have imagined.</i>

104
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,469
<i>So, it's Dad's big race</i>
<i>in less than a week.</i>

105
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,671
<i>Mom normally does</i>
<i>all the kid stuff,</i>

106
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,573
<i>so she thinks leaving</i>
<i>us with him</i>

107
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,742
<i>will stop Dad practicing</i>
<i>for his race.</i>

108
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,479
<i>But I don't think she knows</i>
<i>that man as well as she thinks.</i>

109
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,715
Ladies
and gentlemen,

110
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,218
good afternoon and welcome
to Arlington Stadium.

111
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,690
An afternoon of fun,
thrills and speedway.

112
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,862
But of course, we have to
welcome our resident champion,

113
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,865
the one and only Kevin Jenkins!

114
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,839
<i>Everyone loved</i>
<i>this new champ, but I think</i>

115
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,508
<i>he loved himself</i>
<i>just a little too much.</i>

116
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,581
Come on. Come on!

117
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,693
<i>And as usual,</i>
<i>he won again.</i>

118
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,765
<i>Dad says it's just</i>
<i>about the taking part.</i>

119
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,770
<i>But I could see something</i>
<i>was breaking his heart.</i>

120
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,819
Shouldn't you be at home
changing diapers

121
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,254
or whatever it is daddies do?

122
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,757
I came second, didn't I?

123
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,760
You think second
is winning, huh?

124
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,562
What is your problem?

125
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,830
It's a young man's game.

126
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,336
Go and do something
important, Daddy.

127
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,245
<i>My dad used</i>
<i>to have sponsors.</i>

128
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,114
<i>There was interviews</i>
<i>on TV and everything,</i>

129
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,916
<i>but guess who gets all that now?</i>

130
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,718
Look at all
of these landscapes,

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,888
and America is so huge,
you know, England would fit

132
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,757
into one of these states
and there are 50 of them.

133
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,226
Can you imagine
the biking we could do?

134
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,364
You know that man
at the stadium?

135
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,865
Yeah.

136
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,135
Why was he being mean to you?

137
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,637
Ah, don't worry about him.

138
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,039
Some people are just like that.

139
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,141
Why didn't you do anything?

140
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,143
Like what, hit him?

141
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,345
Mm.

142
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,248
You can't just go around
hitting people.

143
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,185
Violence is almost
never the answer,

144
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,288
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

145
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,825
Are you allowed to hit a bully?

146
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,760
Well, not officially.

147
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,231
I mean... don't tell
your mom I ever said this,

148
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,200
definitely don't tell
any teachers,

149
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,268
but if there's a really
nasty piece of work

150
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,270
and you've tried
everything else,

151
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,773
there's really only
one way to stop them.

152
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,709
But you have to do it right.

153
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,744
Tell us.

154
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,651
Right there,
straight on those nose

155
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,818
with everything you've got.

156
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,854
It doesn't matter
how big you are,

157
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,323
a whack to the nose
and you're down.

158
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,925
But I didn't tell you that.

159
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,731
Goodnight, boys.

160
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,172
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>it's the finals, Lucy,</i>

161
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,140
<i>you know that.</i>

162
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,709
<i>But it's so dangerous.</i>

163
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,747
I miss you.

164
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,383
<i>Same here, okay?</i>

165
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,954
I miss you, too,
but I need to race on Saturday.

166
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,823
It's what I've been
building up to.

167
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,359
Besides, it's good for the boys

168
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,094
to see some healthy competition.

169
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,263
Healthy?

170
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,232
It's noisy and it stinks!

171
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,937
Michael, you put
your life on the line

172
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,939
every time
you get on that thing.

173
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,711
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not 25 anymore.

174
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,446
I know.

175
00:11:54,448 --> 00:12:00,251
You're a father, you need
to start acting responsibly.

176
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,224
How would those boys
feel if the last thing

177
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,794
they saw of you
was a pile of dust?

178
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,935
What else
do I do, Lucy?

179
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,070
What else am I good at?

180
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,441
I'm not even sure
how good I am at that anymore.

181
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,411
- I--
- Sam's up, I've got to go.

182
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,382
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay, bye.

183
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,163
<i>We were still getting out</i>

184
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,231
<i>and about on our bikes.</i>

185
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,369
<i>Until one day we discovered</i>
<i>something much better.</i>

186
00:12:54,474 --> 00:13:01,179
<i>Something new, something safer,</i>
<i>something easy to control.</i>

187
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,417
<i>We wouldn't even need</i>
<i>Mom and Dad to pick us up</i>

188
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,419
<i>or dust us off.</i>

189
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,029
What are you doing?

190
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,130
Playing tennis.

191
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,999
And what are you doing?

192
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,033
Playing football.

193
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,402
No, you're not,
your arms are not swinging,

194
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,837
your legs are not moving.

195
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,972
Let's go outside,
play some ball.

196
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,928
Are you angry?

197
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,399
Look, I can play a boxing
game and it's fun,

198
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,601
but there's nothing like

199
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,069
actually punching that bag.

200
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,338
The feeling in your lungs,
the exertion.

201
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,542
Look, Sam, those devices,
they're amazing.

202
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,313
They've changed the world forever,
the people that have made them are geniuses,

203
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,249
but those geniuses did not
expect the children of today

204
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,451
to be sat there all day
staring into them.

205
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:19,224
Listen to me, you can
play 1,000 motorbike games

206
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,393
with your fingers, but you'll
never get the same feeling

207
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,430
as when you get on that bike,
you feel that engine roar,

208
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,066
that air is your lungs,
dirt in your face.

209
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,401
That is adventure.

210
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,170
It's exercise.

211
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:36,608
And when I'm gone, I do not
want you boys just sat staring

212
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,943
into those screens
for the rest of your life.

213
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,312
Come here.

214
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,249
You want to punch the bag?

215
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,183
Mm-hmm.

216
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,584
All right, punch the bag.

217
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,089
Okay, you want
to punch really hard?

218
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,457
You don't punch the bag.

219
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,194
Look at me, you punch
through the bag.

220
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,634
<i>We didn't realize</i>
<i>at that moment,</i>

221
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,070
<i>what we were about to learn</i>
<i>would soon be used in a life</i>

222
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,238
<i>or death situation.</i>

223
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,480
That's it, come on.

224
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,548
Let's get this going.

225
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,020
Okay, boys, what is this?

226
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,121
A ball.

227
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,991
It's not a ball, it's a
device to train your accuracy.

228
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,459
If you can catch
a ball at high speed,

229
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,528
you can anticipate
a turn, a bump,

230
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,530
you can react
at lightning speed.

231
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,532
Jake, you're up.

232
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,958
Yes!

233
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,126
Yes!

234
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,461
<i>Then the real</i>
<i>training began.</i>

235
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,499
So, what do you want to eat?

236
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,667
- Sweets.
- Chocolate.

237
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,335
Come with me.

238
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,376
<i>To Dad, this was</i>
<i>his worst nightmare.</i>

239
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,346
<i>One day we might not do</i>
<i>anything for real.</i>

240
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,449
<i>In his eyes, something</i>
<i>drastic had to be done.</i>

241
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,261
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

242
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,496
Look at all the colors.

243
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,499
Nature has made all these
amazing things for us.

244
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,102
Here, do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

245
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,339
How many?
- I don't know exactly, but a lot more than you can

246
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,041
on sweets and chocolate, okay?

247
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,413
Okay, boys, what is this?

248
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,149
- A piece of paper.
- Wrong again.

249
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,483
Everything is what you make it.

250
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,421
This is good exercise,
this is running in fields,

251
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:40,058
this is air in your lungs,
but you have to make it so.

252
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,761
You just never know where a little piece of paper can take you.

253
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,278
<i>At first, it was just me,</i>

254
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,217
<i>then my best friend, then three,</i>

255
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,420
<i>then the whole class.</i>

256
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,593
<i>Even the girls joined in.</i>

257
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,144
<i>And then, there she was.</i>

258
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,119
<i>I should've said something.</i>

259
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,324
<i>But I wasn't brave enough.</i>

260
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:49,827
<i>Not yet.</i>

261
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,674
And when Christopher
Columbus was sailing

262
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:08,179
those seven seas,
he experienced things

263
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,781
that others could
only dream about.

264
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,218
Your next topic, I want you all

265
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,321
to think wisely about Columbus.

266
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,359
How was he feeling when
just he had discovered

267
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,296
such a magnificent
and beautiful sight?

268
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,935
And Master Samuel Harris,
if you spent just a little more

269
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,472
time looking at your school
book than you do at Amelie,

270
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,307
you might just pass
with flying colors.

271
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,793
Uh... uh... um.

272
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,596
Everything is what you make it.

273
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,565
You have to make it so.

274
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,334
Uh, do you want to come
to the races on Saturday?

275
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,438
No!

276
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,876
Okay.

277
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,481
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I did that in private.</i>

278
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,592
<i>Somehow,</i>
<i>my heart was beating</i>

279
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,895
<i>faster than ever at Dad's after</i>
<i>school practice.</i>

280
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,385
- Hello, Mommy.
- Hey, boys.

281
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,853
- <i>Hello, Mommy.</i>
- How are you?

282
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,355
<i>We've been flying</i>
<i>paper airplanes--</i>

283
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,422
<i>We've been going on</i>

284
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,690
<i>bike rides in the fields.</i>

285
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,492
<i>We've been flying</i>
<i>through the air.</i>

286
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,728
- Daddy through the ball and...
- I-- I--

287
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,463
- ...I caught it, and then we...
- Paper airplanes.

288
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,265
<i>Went to the field</i>
<i>and I did epic jumps.</i>

289
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>We went over the ramp</i>
<i>with the scooter--</i>

290
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,502
- <i>We did BMXing through--</i>
- <i>We climbed the frame</i>

291
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,637
<i>- loads of times.</i>
- Uh, huh.

292
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,872
<i>- And it was really fun.</i>
- Uh, huh.

293
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,310
- And also, this girl, Amelie.
<i>- Uh, huh.</i>

294
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,679
I asked her out
to Daddy's race on Saturday.

295
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,614
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

296
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,651
Mommy misses you.

297
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,987
<i>We miss you too, Mommy.</i>

298
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,658
<i>We're going</i>
<i>on a bike ride now.</i>

299
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,760
- <i>Bye, Mommy.</i>
- Going to go on a bike ride now.

300
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,328
<i>- Bye, Mom.</i>
- I love you, boys.

301
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,663
Love you too, Mom.

302
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,731
You be careful.

303
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,533
Bye, Mom.

304
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,651
Bye, Daddy,
we're off to practice.

305
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,787
Oh, well, bye, boys.

306
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,921
Bye, Daddy.

307
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,790
Be careful.

308
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,871
"Beyond the dark windmill,
two swallows hold the key."

309
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,908
Let's just leave it,
it's not meant for us.

310
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,944
Wait, the dark windmill,

311
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,046
that's the other side
of the downs.

312
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,482
Yeah, but that's miles away.

313
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,584
Come on, let's investigate it.

314
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,983
<i>Two swallows hold the key.</i>

315
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,854
Look, over there!

316
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:44,081
"B13, midnight sparkles."

317
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,983
B for books?

318
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,785
B for bad idea.

319
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,553
Come on, let's go back.

320
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:51,889
Wait.

321
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:59,163
B13, B13, there are 14
bunkers or Kneecap Hill.

322
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,235
Remember, we went on a walk
there with Mom and Dad.

323
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,504
That's miles away.

324
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,606
It's going to be
getting dark soon.

325
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,946
Remember, Dad said we should be
having adventures.

326
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,852
Look, we've got a key,
let's at least investigate.

327
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,312
There's 12.

328
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,917
There, 13 this must be it.

329
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,758
Look, there's
something inside.

330
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,729
Oh, yeah, what is that?

331
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,787
Come on, boys.

332
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,332
No!

333
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,636
That can't be right.

334
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,106
It's hours until midnight.

335
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,982
- There's someone in there.
- You what?

336
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,317
Wow, diamonds.

337
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,986
Do you think they're real?

338
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,655
Well, how about we find out?

339
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,128
Are you sure?

340
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,866
- Movement.
- I don't know.

341
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,739
Oi!

342
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:56,674
Oi!

343
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,281
Come on.

344
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,388
Gee!

345
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,390
What the--

346
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,768
- It's empty.
- No.

347
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:28,939
That's not possible.

348
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,140
Not without the key.

349
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,275
How have they got the key?

350
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,145
Are you okay?

351
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,781
Just, go get them!

352
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,852
Quick, they're coming.

353
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,864
Ah, where they gone?

354
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,066
Hang on.

355
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,737
Catch.

356
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,315
- Right.
- Go, go, go.

357
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,418
Eh?

358
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,225
- That way.
- There.

359
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,129
Quick, now go.

360
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,835
What? Hey.

361
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,142
There
he is, come here.

362
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,978
Run, Reynolds, run!

363
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,913
All right, come here.

364
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,414
Quick, come on, come on.

365
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,250
Power it, power it!

366
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,220
- Come here!
- Get the other one,

367
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,889
get the other one.

368
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,462
Freeze!

369
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,271
Come on!

370
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,506
They're getting away.

371
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,319
Down here.

372
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,194
Right.

373
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:47,878
We've lost them.

374
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,257
Hello, Daddy.

375
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,994
Hello, Daddy.
- Hey, boys, wait a second.

376
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,495
Boys, I was worried about you.

377
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,164
You've been ages.

378
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:08,999
Are you okay?

379
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,136
I was thinking, you know,
if you want to have a go

380
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,138
at the goggle-pad,
it's okay with me.

381
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,308
Maybe like, uh, ten minute
slots or something?

382
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,077
Boss is going to kill us.

383
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,179
How did they find them?

384
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,481
Maybe the note that blew away?

385
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,916
What?

386
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,453
I was halfway through writing
the note for the exchange,

387
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:33,423
and I wanted to be outside,
you know, around the bloom.

388
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,927
Flowers are amazing
at this time of year.

389
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,262
I didn't want to miss out.

390
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,100
And the wind picked up
and blew it away.

391
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:46,103
I tried to grab it,
but it was gone.

392
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,071
I thought it got stuck
in a bush somewhere, so...

393
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,307
I wrote another.

394
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,111
Great.

395
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,924
You're meant to be the fastest,
you couldn't even grab them.

396
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,359
Well, it wasn't my idea to hide the diamonds in the first place,
was it?

397
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,162
Well, if it wasn't for me,
we wouldn't have even spotted the kids.

398
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,031
You were
the one that lost that note.

399
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,933
That note was a stupid idea.

400
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,335
Do you know, I never
wanted to be a criminal anyway.

401
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,503
I wanted to be a gardener.

402
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:23,307
I wanted to have a plot of land,
some tulips and some grass.

403
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:29,513
Yeah, but my mom said,
"You haven't got green fingers.

404
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,415
You've got sticky fingers."

405
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,050
Shut...

406
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,618
up.

407
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,688
Look at these things,
they could be worth a fortune.

408
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,023
What do you think
we should do with the money?

409
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,730
Right now those two little boys

410
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:50,167
are making fools of both of you.

411
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,736
Buy a helicopter.

412
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,173
Or even better, a private jet.

413
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,749
We could help the poor people
Daddy tells us about.

414
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,659
With your share
of the profit, hmm?

415
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:21,631
you could buy a patch of
land that you could tend

416
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,501
for the remainder
of your living days.

417
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,504
What do you think Mommy
and Daddy would want?

418
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,141
A trip to America,
no doubt about it.

419
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:37,147
But without it,
the only digging will be

420
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,384
that of two shallow graves.

421
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:44,554
One the size of your body.

422
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,460
And one half the size
of your body.

423
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,468
- Just half?
- Oh, yes.

424
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:03,640
Because the other half
will be stuffed and mounted

425
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:07,077
above my desk
as a warning to others

426
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,680
that mistakes will
not be tolerated.

427
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,487
Should we tell Daddy?

428
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,058
No, let's just
keep it a surprise.

429
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,627
Do I make myself clear?

430
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,730
Yeah, completely.

431
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,700
I mean, especially
the bit about the...

432
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,804
the other half body thing.

433
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,305
Just go!

434
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,075
Let's find out what
they're worth first.

435
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,609
Bring me my diamonds.

436
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,514
Or... those two boys.

437
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,215
Look, jewelry.

438
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,283
Surely, he'll know
how much it's worth.

439
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,385
- Ask him.
- No, you ask him.

440
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,221
- No, you ask him.
- No, you ask him.

441
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,322
- No, you ask.
- No, you ask--

442
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,656
Can I help you?

443
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,627
Oh, uh, yes, we have
something to show you.

444
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,762
We want to know how
much it's worth.

445
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,470
It's worthless, I'm afraid.

446
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,639
Junk.

447
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,612
You boys are after a bit
of pocket money, aren't you?

448
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,249
Well, I'll take it off
your hands for a tenner.

449
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,619
Ten whole pound you didn't
have before you came in here.

450
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,824
No, thank you.

451
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,364
Okay, 50, 100?

452
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,568
1,000?

453
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:46,970
Oh.

454
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,640
You're a good negotiator.

455
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,483
There they are.

456
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,919
That's, that's the antique shop.

457
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,821
Yes!

458
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:10,427
- Come on, they must've sold them.
- They, they've sold them?

459
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,255
Boo!

460
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,896
Look, it's as I've told you.
They only had one

461
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,265
and they took it away!

462
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,980
Those men,
they must be criminals.

463
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,715
What if they come here?

464
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,426
Don't worry about them,
I got a plan.

465
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,601
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,135
These are begonias,
they're meant to be in bloom,

467
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:36,840
- but look at them.
- There's half a million pounds of our diamonds in there,

468
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:40,043
and all you're worried
about is the blooming.

469
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,046
I'm just saying,
anyone prepared to let

470
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,382
begonias get
in a state like this.

471
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,917
I'm just trying to figure out what kind of people we're dealing with.

472
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,519
Dealing with?

473
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,388
When the boss finds out
that two snotty-nosed

474
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,757
little kids made off
with our diamonds,

475
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,494
you'll know what we're dealing with.
- don't be fooled.

476
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,895
I need to relax.

477
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,064
Kick back.

478
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:08,972
In the 1920's,

479
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,708
kids went up chimneys,
down coal mines,

480
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,444
their blackened faces
risking more life than limb,

481
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,012
than any adult ever could.

482
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,048
They work for big powerful
businessmen.

483
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,105
On a BMX?

484
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,456
Just saying, kids work
for drug cartels

485
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,658
on, on, on roller skates!

486
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,533
Just be careful, that's all.

487
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,939
Just tread carefully,
there's a light on.

488
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,223
You boys
had me worried.

489
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,193
Are you sure there's
nothing you need to tell me?

490
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,564
Security light!

491
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:08,998
Oh, ah!

492
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,840
Thought
I heard something.

493
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,077
That's quite
a nice bush, actually.

494
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,979
Goodnight, Jake.

495
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,116
- What's--
- What the--

496
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,922
It's rigged.

497
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:40,563
Let's get in there.

498
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,541
Dogs probably.

499
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,543
Sweet dreams then, Jake.

500
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,280
Right, right, right,
if you remove just one panel

501
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,215
of glass, get to the door
handle, then we're in.

502
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,051
Here, borrow
my gardening gloves.

503
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,154
- Go on.
- Pink?

504
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:19,802
Okay.

505
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,573
All right.

506
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,916
Right.

507
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,811
All right, I'm going
to smash my way in.

508
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,348
Oh, my God.

509
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,851
- It's Mike Harris.
- What?

510
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,287
The speedway rider, look!

511
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,090
This must be his house.

512
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:48,725
Oh, my God.

513
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,294
I was at the Euro
Championships '94.

514
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,230
He was three bikes back, then on the last lap,
he canes it up on the inside,

515
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,399
front wheel almost
doesn't touch the ground.

516
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,635
Boom, right on the line,
he takes from Henshall.

517
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,870
It was just beautiful.

518
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,138
I bet that trophy is
here somewhere--

519
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,641
- Right, that's it.
- No, no, no, no, wait.

520
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,110
This is perfect.

521
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,779
Harris hasn't won for a while.

522
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,081
All these new kids,
younger, faster,

523
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,951
I bet he hasn't won
any prize money for yonks.

524
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,220
I hear his sponsor pulled out
and backed some other kid.

525
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:18,788
What are you talking about?

526
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,662
No one knows who took
those diamonds.

527
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,399
If the police think he did,
and it makes perfect sense,

528
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,768
he would need another
source of income.

529
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,773
So... I'll make an anonymous
call to the police,

530
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:40,276
tell them that I know for
a fact that Mike Harris has

531
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,880
the diamonds and he has them
right there in his very house.

532
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:48,051
They'll go there, find the
diamonds for us, the diamonds,

533
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,053
they'll end up in
the evidence room for what?

534
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,821
Two, three days
before they've done

535
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,423
the paperwork, and then
they'll return them.

536
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:54,824
How do you know that?

537
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,327
Because my mom works down
at that police station.

538
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,696
Your mom works for the police?

539
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,465
As a cleaner.

540
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:06,069
She's cool and she's
very supportive.

541
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,872
And the other thing is, she
can get into that evidence room

542
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,444
on her cleaning duties, which
happens to be tomorrow night.

543
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:18,214
She can slip the diamonds back
to us, and from then on,

544
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,382
we're in the clear.

545
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:23,119
Meanwhile, Mike Harris
will be speeding

546
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,755
his way to a life behind bars.

547
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,958
What do you say, guys?

548
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,936
I like it.

549
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,505
But on one condition.

550
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:47,343
If we try this
and it doesn't work,

551
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:53,015
it'll be the last thing
you ever do, ever.

552
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:56,886
Hmm?

553
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,322
Yes, sir.

554
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,894
- Yeah.
- Goody, goody, gumdrops.

555
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,195
Let's do it.

556
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,441
- Jake.
- Thank you.

557
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,443
Sam.

558
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:24,514
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, Daddy.

559
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,149
My pleasure.

560
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,324
Boys, have you been
messing around down here?

561
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,426
There's a brick on
a piece of string.

562
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,964
- Do you think that--
- Who do you think it was?

563
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:46,335
<i>Negative, sir,</i>

564
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,204
<i>there's a car parked</i>
<i>in the drive.</i>

565
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,939
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

566
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:52,041
There's something
that we need to tell you.

567
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,811
Right.

568
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,046
- Um.
- Tell me in a minute.

569
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:58,881
I'll just go and get the door.

570
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,523
Do you think it's about the diamonds?
- No.

571
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,059
Can I help you?

572
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,227
Mr. Michael Harris?

573
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:14,063
Detective Inspector
Peter Hector.

574
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,833
That's a lovely motor
you've got there.

575
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,502
Bit of a diamond,
wouldn't you say?

576
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,437
If this is about
that number plate,

577
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,206
it never goes off
the end of that drive.

578
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,845
It's not about the number
plate, is it?

579
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,313
Mr. Michael Harris,

580
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,848
we are entering your premises

581
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,983
in accordance with section 32

582
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,485
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984--

583
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,020
Wait, wait, what is this about?

584
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,558
- Just stay calm.
- I am calm,

585
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,627
- but this is ridiculous.
- Is it now?

586
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,065
It must be to do
with the diamonds.

587
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,967
Shall we tell them?

588
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:54,537
- Where's the boys' mother?
- She's back home in America.

589
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,605
Is she now?

590
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:59,075
- Who do you think--
- What should we do?

591
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,643
Sir, I found them.

592
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,579
That's, that's not mine.

593
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,249
Precisely.

594
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:09,518
Mr. Michael Harris, I am
arresting you on suspicion

595
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,121
of the theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds--

596
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,624
- Boys, I didn't do anything.
- You do not need to say anything,

597
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:17,126
- but it may harm your--
- This is ridiculous.

598
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,161
- I've done nothing wrong. Boys.
- You do not have to say anything,

599
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,663
- but it harm your defense...
- Ah, ah, ah.

600
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,099
...when questioned,
something you later rely on...

601
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,912
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- No!

602
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,179
- He didn't do anything.
- Calm down.

603
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,915
- We found them.
- Calm down.

604
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,082
- But, but--
- He'll be fine.

605
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,517
We'll look after him, okay?

606
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,321
Boys, I know this is
upsetting, but this is the law,

607
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,456
and the law is there
to protect you and us.

608
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,925
But, but he didn't
do anything.

609
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,426
He didn't, we found-- But--

610
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,628
Now, listen to me, your
mommy's going to be contacted,

611
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,997
but until she returns,
you need to come with us.

612
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,104
It's a really nice
facility, boys,

613
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,941
with very caring professionals.

614
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,677
You'll be well looked after,
you just need to come with us.

615
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:19,422
But we need our teddies,
otherwise we'll be very sad.

616
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,494
Okay then, let's go
get the teddies.

617
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:41,377
Jake, run!
- No, you don't, come here. Come here, you two.

618
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,280
Oh,
come on. Stop, stop.

619
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,018
Jake, out the window!

620
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,721
Where are they?

621
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:56,392
Oh. oh, my God,
the window.

622
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,661
I can't see them,
they must have jumped.

623
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:02,548
We're going to have
to radio this in.

624
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,032
Hey, stop, you two! Come here!

625
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,006
Stop!

626
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,243
Where do you think you're going?

627
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,048
Hey, hey, where are you going?

628
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,117
Hey, stop, stop!

629
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,192
Where did you--
Come back. Come here.

630
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,596
Boys, stop!

631
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:41,604
They're getting away!

632
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,774
Hey, come on.

633
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:46,675
Hey, oi!

634
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,778
Stop these boys!

635
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,252
I'll go and radio it in.

636
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:08,130
All units, we have
our suspect under arrest,

637
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:09,265
stolen diamonds in hand.

638
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,701
Two boys on the run.

639
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:15,304
I repeat,
two children on the run.

640
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:24,146
Description, one blonde,
about, well...

641
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:27,216
not very high, um.

642
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,254
Don't touch me!

643
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,241
- Don't you touch me!
- Enjoy your stay with us.

644
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:38,227
We look forward
to welcoming you again.

645
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,662
- This way.
- Next!

646
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,398
Right,
down the stairs, come on.

647
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,568
And who might you be?

648
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,170
Mike, Michael Harris.

649
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:52,141
Michael, lovely.

650
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:55,277
Occupation?

651
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:56,745
Speedway rider.

652
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,448
Speedway rider.

653
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,351
That's very good.

654
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,490
Speedway rider.

655
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,894
Speedway rider.

656
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,572
Fabulous, reason for arrest?

657
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:27,676
Theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds.

658
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,845
- Disgusting.
- I, I didn't.

659
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:33,482
Disgusting.

660
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,517
Is this some kind of joke?

661
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,484
Joke?

662
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,420
We take crime very seriously.

663
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,824
Very seriously, indeed.

664
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:49,298
I've spent 23 years with
criminal after criminal,

665
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:54,870
and I don't know
how much more... I can take.

666
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,606
Look, my kids are out there,
God only knows where,

667
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,542
and no one's doing
a thing about it.

668
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:07,516
Well, no disrespect, but maybe
a little less grand theft

669
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,421
and you might be at home
playing pass the parcel

670
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,689
and eating ice cream.

671
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,327
Cell number seven.

672
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,631
Enjoy your stay.

673
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,668
We look forward to working
with you again.

674
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,418
This is all our fault.

675
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,321
We can make it right.

676
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,822
Should we call Mommy?

677
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,490
We just got Daddy arrested.

678
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,492
Calling Mommy is not an option.

679
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,569
We have to get Daddy out.

680
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,338
Plus it's his race on Saturday.

681
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,540
He'll never forgive us
if he misses that.

682
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,419
I'm hungry.

683
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,724
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

684
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,693
Do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

685
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,299
When I'm gone, I do not want
you boys just sat staring

686
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,501
into those screens for
the rest of your life.

687
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,570
Come on, I've got a plan.

688
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:39,875
Come on.

689
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,535
Oi, you two, come back here!

690
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,572
Here! Hey!

691
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,087
All units.

692
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,059
All units, all units
to Glen Close.

693
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,767
Glen Close, that's brilliant.

694
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:57,840
I'm being serious, those two
little boys have escaped again.

695
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,944
Yeah, all, all units,
all units up Meryl Street.

696
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,047
Those kids again.

697
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,972
- Hey, Lucy, how are you?
- Michael, I've been worried.

698
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,674
- I've been calling and calling.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

699
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:36,278
The boys and I have just
been playing and playing.

700
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,165
You know how it is.

701
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,049
Okay... would you put them on?

702
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:44,820
I'd like to talk to them.

703
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,055
Uh, yeah, of course, of course.

704
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,892
Hey, boys, do you want
to take a break

705
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,261
from the tennis
and talk to your mommy?

706
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:56,865
- Really sorry.
- Really sorry.

707
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,767
We'll pay you back, we promise.

708
00:58:58,769 --> 00:58:59,968
- We promise.
- We'll pay you back.

709
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,870
- Sorry, so sorry.
- Come back, come back!

710
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,038
<i>No?</i>

711
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:04,706
Really?

712
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,745
Hey, Sam, be nice to
Jake, all right?

713
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:10,846
None of that stuff.

714
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,652
Cheeky boys, you know
how they are, right?

715
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,723
Okay, as long
as everything's fine.

716
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,996
Is everything fine, Michael?

717
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:29,865
Fine.

718
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:31,199
Everything is great.

719
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:34,903
<i>It's all under control.</i>

720
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:36,638
Okay.

721
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,142
See you soon, right?

722
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:43,972
Well, if you really
didn't do this,

723
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,675
yet the diamonds were
found in your house.

724
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:51,813
You have to consider that
the real thieves are your boys.

725
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,649
No, no way.

726
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:57,953
In my line of work, we normally
find when people run,

727
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,955
they're guilty of something.

728
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,289
My boys are good boys.

729
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,358
They would never do
something like that.

730
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,862
Let me show you something.

731
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:29,117
So, your boys would never
do something like that, eh?

732
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:31,920
Quite terrified, the poor lady.

733
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,259
Probably a small mercy
we don't have the sound.

734
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:14,930
Come on, come on.

735
01:02:29,146 --> 01:02:31,012
PC 383 Jackson.

736
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,416
Uh, I'm sorry?

737
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,051
Who is this?

738
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,522
Lucy Harris,
who the hell are you?

739
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,191
I'm the policeman
guarding your house

740
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:46,995
while your husband's in jail and
your kids are on the run, miss.

741
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,301
What?

742
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,346
- Hello?
- It's Lucy Harris.

743
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:06,348
Get my husband on
the phone, please.

744
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,150
Do not put me on hold.

745
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:11,453
- <i>Well, just what--</i>
- <i>I am not waiting...</i>

746
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,088
- No, no, no.
<i>- ...any longer.</i>

747
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,323
<i>Just give him the phone.</i>

748
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,391
All right.

749
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,562
There's a call for you.

750
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:22,097
- No.
- Now, officially,

751
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,332
you're not meant to
have any more calls,

752
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,434
- but this lady here...
- No, no, no, no.

753
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:29,371
...she's phoned about 57 times,
and she's not going to

754
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,474
- let it go, so, uh.
- No, just tell her

755
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,509
- I'm not in.
- Oh.

756
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:39,915
I'm just handing the phone
to your husband, madam,

757
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,316
in his cell.

758
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,926
- <i>Lucy.</i>
- Michael.

759
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:54,062
- What is going on?
<i>- Just--</i>

760
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,331
I leave you for a week
and this is what happens?

761
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,900
Stolen diamonds,
boys on the run?

762
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:02,237
- You-- Where are they, Michael?
- Just let me explain.

763
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:04,105
<i>I knew you were</i>
<i>irresponsible,</i>

764
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,473
<i>but this is off the scale--</i>

765
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,175
- Ma'am.
- <i>Just--</i>

766
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,444
I am on the next flight.

767
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,247
Listen... just let me explain.

768
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:15,150
I'm sorry.

769
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:06,287
<i>Well, I don't know</i>
<i>if it was that weird dream</i>

770
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:11,092
<i>or the church, but I remember</i>
<i>something someone once said.</i>

771
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:14,629
<i>"If you are lost and</i>
<i>you don't know what to do...</i>

772
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,066
<i>you should retrace your steps."</i>

773
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,769
<i>So, that is what</i>
<i>we're going to do.</i>

774
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,415
Stop, wait!

775
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:58,306
This must be where
they were watching us from.

776
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:09,751
- This looks like a bomb.
- Jake, just put it down.

777
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:53,128
<i>Suddenly, those years of lip reading practice came in handy.</i>

778
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,465
<i>Even with my lip reading skills,</i>
<i>this was a tough one.</i>

779
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,136
<i>I couldn't be sure,</i>
<i>but he said something</i>

780
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:02,403
<i>about the police station.</i>

781
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:06,541
<i>And a cleaner mom, very odd.</i>

782
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,477
<i>That was not the owner</i>
<i>of the shop.</i>

783
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,813
<i>Those criminals have done</i>
<i>something with him.</i>

784
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,548
Boo!

785
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,183
<i>I can only imagine</i>

786
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:16,684
<i>how terrible.</i>

787
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,453
<i>If we're ever going</i>

788
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:19,821
<i>to get Daddy out, it was time</i>

789
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,689
<i>to do something</i>
<i>a bit more drastic.</i>

790
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,595
<i>I knew I'd seen</i>
<i>that face before.</i>

791
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,600
<i>Now this cleaner mom thing</i>
<i>is starting to make sense.</i>

792
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:07,235
<i>Is she in on this?</i>

793
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:33,228
Do you mind?

794
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,630
You are meant to be
a cleaner, not a masseuse.

795
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:37,999
Well, I've cleaned
everything else.

796
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,402
Everything except
the evidence room.

797
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,572
I could go down and do that.

798
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,307
I just need the key.

799
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:50,812
We don't clean
the evidence room.

800
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:54,949
No one ever cleans
the evidence room.

801
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:58,319
The evidence room is
a dank and dirty place

802
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:01,789
full of unspeakable things
from unspeakable crimes.

803
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,427
Well, I'll just stay
here then. Carry on.

804
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,796
I've got two hours
of my shift left.

805
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:11,399
We'll soon have you
spick and span.

806
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,008
<i>Bon Appétit.</i>

807
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,576
<i>Merci, señor.</i>

808
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:27,949
I warn you, the smell
down there is so pungent

809
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:31,786
that you and your little
pompom friend

810
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,322
won't be down there very long.

811
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,598
I don't know what's wrong with that officer Pierce.

812
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,467
Perhaps he needs to get
himself a girlfriend.

813
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,436
Would you do?

814
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:23,571
- Or a boyfriend.
- Yeah, move over.

815
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:26,708
I mean, and that one in cell 12,
for goodness sake,

816
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,443
he is really--

817
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,979
I got the keys, son.

818
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:36,918
Wait out the back and I'll have
those gems to you in no time.

819
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:40,054
All right, Mom.

820
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:41,989
Yeah.

821
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:45,593
Bye.

822
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,077
What was that?

823
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,717
What the blazes?

824
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:20,121
What have you done
to this poor woman?

825
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,590
- Arrest them!
- Jake, run!

826
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,692
Stop, come here,
boys. Come here.

827
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,128
Come here then.

828
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,464
Stop, you little.

829
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,599
Stop,
come here, you two!

830
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:33,968
Stop!

831
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,188
Oh, my God.

832
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,924
Stop.

833
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:03,998
Stop, hmm?

834
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,067
Just--

835
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,569
Hang on. Just stop, all right?

836
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,271
You don't know
what's going on, do you?

837
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:13,007
The cleaner's son is outside
at the back door right now

838
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,208
waiting for the diamonds!

839
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,845
That is ridiculous.

840
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,948
What the, what?

841
01:15:25,171 --> 01:15:26,721
This man, I know where he is,
I can get him for you,

842
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,122
if you give me my dad back.

843
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,060
Well, if you can prove
he's the real thief,

844
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,228
your dad goes free.

845
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:51,879
Hello, boys.

846
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:54,081
May I help you?

847
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:57,251
Your boys have failed
to get the diamonds.

848
01:15:57,253 --> 01:16:00,187
You need us, we're ready
to make a deal.

849
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,790
A deal?

850
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:09,096
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

851
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:10,798
But okay.

852
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,801
It's my deal, huh?

853
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:18,039
Give me the diamonds
or I'll snap his neck like a...

854
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,742
how do you say, uh,
a lolly stick.

855
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,744
That's my brother!

856
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,713
Then you'd better be quick

857
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,182
or I'll snap both your necks.

858
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,319
Violence is almost
never the answer,

859
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:33,888
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

860
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:38,726
You're a bully, aren't you?

861
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,631
I'm only just getting started.

862
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:46,801
Right there,
straight on the nose

863
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,369
with everything you've got.

864
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,081
You want
to punch really hard?

865
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:02,617
Punch through the bag.

866
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,335
<i>Wait a second,</i>
<i>let's rewind a bit.</i>

867
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:28,976
<i>Detective Hector did check out</i>
<i>my story, and guess what?</i>

868
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:32,380
<i>They got those guys.</i>

869
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,686
<i>But then I did have to deal with a little bit of technology,</i>

870
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,088
<i>but for the right reasons.</i>

871
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,159
A deal?

872
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,362
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

873
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,437
<i>It turns out the police</i>
<i>don't much like bullies either.</i>

874
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,110
<i>I stole those diamonds.</i>

875
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,713
<i>All in all, I think</i>
<i>it was a pretty good</i>

876
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:07,915
<i>day's work for Detective Hector.</i>

877
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,686
<i>But there was still one</i>
<i>pretty major thing left to do.</i>

878
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:18,859
<i>And we really have to do it</i>
<i>before Mommy gets back.</i>

879
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:28,269
Boys, God,
I've missed you.

880
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:31,005
I missed you, boys.

881
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,340
I missed you so much.

882
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,775
I really have.

883
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:38,846
Just a little paperwork.

884
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,748
Three to four hours
and you'll be out of here.

885
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:43,951
You'll be in time
for your race, Daddy.

886
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,021
No, boys, I don't care
about any of that now.

887
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:49,390
The fact is you're safe, and
that's all that matters to me.

888
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:52,393
You have to,
it's who you are.

889
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:54,462
It's what you love.

890
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:56,864
<i>And Jake was right.</i>

891
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:02,803
But my race is in 30 minutes.

892
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:10,311
Put these on.

893
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:12,513
You can do it,
Daddy. Come on.

894
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,249
<i>It was like watching</i>
<i>Daddy come alive again.</i>

895
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,853
Don't forget
to polish that chrome.

896
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,755
I want to shine when I win.

897
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,256
Sure.

898
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,098
Your radio, get me
the officer in charge.

899
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,267
Now.

900
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:10,504
Sarge.

901
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,309
- Hi.
- Mrs. Harris,

902
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,045
- Detective Hector here.
- What is going on here?

903
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:21,382
We have your husband and
your boys, everyone is safe.

904
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:24,051
It was a wrongful arrest,
I'm afraid.

905
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:26,554
We're escorting them
right now to the race track.

906
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,558
You're taking them where?

907
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:35,362
His race, we should just
about make it in time.

908
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:37,097
Are you insane?

909
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,166
<i>No!</i>

910
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,234
Mrs. Harris.

911
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:44,438
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

912
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,507
Here.

913
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:52,112
I'll, uh, just use your loo, and
then I'll be on my way, miss.

914
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:55,316
Unbelievable.

915
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,235
I'm going to be speeding,
by the way.

916
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,146
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thank you.

917
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,282
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thank you.

918
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:29,583
- Go fast.
- See you from the stand.

919
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,508
How long do I have?

920
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:02,349
The riders
are lining up for the finals.

921
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,201
And they're off!

922
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,103
A great start from Chris Warren,

923
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,571
but local champ, Kevin Jenkins,

924
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,140
is having none of that.

925
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:32,446
Jenkins leads, but Mike
Harris is catching up.

926
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:42,222
And he's chasing his tail.

927
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,227
Jenkins leads.
Harris is catching up.

928
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,563
He's really giving
his all today.

929
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,666
Watching as Mike Harris
overtakes into the turn.

930
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,401
Unbelievable!

931
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,437
Oh, Harris is down!

932
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:57,438
Mike Harris is down.

933
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,039
Red flag.

934
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,108
Harris is down.

935
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:03,277
This looks like a bad one.

936
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,611
He's not moving.

937
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:06,380
The helmet's off.

938
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:08,482
Medics, medics.

939
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:15,122
Ladies and gentlemen,
he's moving.

940
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:18,425
Well, that'll be it
for Mike Harris.

941
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,362
Mike Harris will be
surely leaving the race,

942
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:22,763
ladies and gentlemen.

943
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:51,191
Don't worry, he'll be okay.

944
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:54,728
And that's it,
Mike Harris is out.

945
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,498
No, wait, please.

946
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,333
Just, my boys are watching.

947
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,269
If they see me walk
away like this,

948
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:03,537
what does that teach them?

949
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:06,340
I want them to know
anything is possible.

950
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:09,176
You're a father,
you understand that, right?

951
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:11,745
Please just let me finish this.

952
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:15,315
Just let me race
and I promise you,

953
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:17,584
I'll never race again.

954
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:22,356
Wait.

955
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,291
- Thank you.
- Incredibly,

956
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:26,126
the Marshall has overruled.

957
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:29,463
Mike Harris is allowed
one more race.

958
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:33,600
<i>Riders,</i>
<i>you have two minutes.</i>

959
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:41,408
<i>Mommy and Daddy</i>
<i>haven't looked at each other</i>

960
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,210
<i>like this since</i>
<i>we've been alive.</i>

961
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:52,586
<i>It's something called</i>
<i>support... and appreciation.</i>

962
01:24:54,156 --> 01:24:55,656
<i>And we should all do it more.</i>

963
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,595
<i>What else am I good at?</i>
- <i>It's so dangerous.</i>

964
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,130
<i>Go and do</i>
<i>something important.</i>

965
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,431
<i>Why didn't</i>
<i>you do anything?</i>

966
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,866
<i>It's a young man's game.</i>

967

<i>You have to,</i>
<i>it's who you are.</i>

968

- <i>When I'm gone...</i>
- <i>It's what you love.</i>

969
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:12,606
<i>...I do not want you boys sat</i>
<i>staring into those devices for</i>

970
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,108
<i>the rest of your life.</i>

971
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,643
Riders are lined up.

972
01:25:18,214 --> 01:25:19,379
Counting down.

973
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:28,188
And they're off. An incredible start for Harris.
He's flying, folks.

974
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,724
Phenomenal turn, I've never
seen anything like it.

975
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,226
Jenkins battered with dirt.

976
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:33,694
Harris powering forward.

977
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:36,730
This is like the Euro
Championship of '94.

978
01:25:39,235 --> 01:25:41,869
Jenkins gives it all,
it's nowhere near enough.

979
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:47,574
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike Harris wins.

980
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,811
What a celebration this will be.

981
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:10,364
<i>Those TV people</i>
<i>asked Kevin Jenkins</i>

982
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:14,401
<i>what it was like to be a loser</i>
<i>and he declined to comment.</i>

983
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:21,441
<i>We all make mistakes,</i>
<i>it's a part of life.</i>

984
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:23,544
<i>But when we do,</i>
<i>it's how we fix them.</i>

985
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,514
- Keep the change!
- Sorry again!

986
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,615
Bye.

987
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,928
Come on, let's get back
to our cell.

988
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,797
<i>What goes around</i>
<i>comes around.</i>

989
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:49,770
<i>Sometimes we have to accept</i>
<i>that things are unfair,</i>

990
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:51,505
<i>but maybe there's a reason.</i>

991
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:00,347
<i>Now Daddy does drive</i>
<i>that old car,</i>

992
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:01,982
<i>but only for special occasions.</i>

993
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:05,219
Ah, Mr. Harris, I presume?

994
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:08,722
And you must be
the two young lads.

995
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:14,695
Master Jake and Master Samuel,
come this way.

996
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:16,330
<i>And what could</i>
<i>be more special</i>

997
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:18,966
<i>than visiting England's</i>
<i>largest castle?</i>

998
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:22,536
Lady Hurst
is expecting you, sir.

999
01:27:22,538 --> 01:27:23,737
Thank you.

1000
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,917
May I present, Lady Hurst.

1001
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,419
Master Jake and Master Samuel.

1002
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:46,326
You have both shown incredible
bravery and courage,

1003
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:48,462
and that must be rewarded.

1004
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:01,541
<i>I'm sure I saw</i>
<i>a tear in Daddy's eye,</i>

1005
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:03,944

1006

<i>Well, here's a little clue.</i>

1009
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,423
<i>And did I get my dream girl?</i>

1010
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:18,892
